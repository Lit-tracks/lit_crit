        <li><p> Every book is full of a story. As such, it is only proper that a story be told for all to hear. Every book has a story to tell, from historic tales to recall, to fictional scenes where one fights dragons and evil wizards. However, not every book is easily remembered, for they lack a story worth telling. A story worth telling would have to be a story that catches the reader. A story filled with progression, a story that is able to give a reader a beginning and end, with character development and achievement against adversity, a story of historic moments or fantasy. It is these elements that brings readers in and fasinates them in the story. Once you have the reader's attention, you have a story worth telling.
          <br><br>
                What makes Molokai a story worth telling is the the usage of a historic event and putting the reader into the heart of it through the main character. It brings out a perspective on how life was in Molokai during World War II and the problem with leprosy. To make matters interesting to the reader, the main character is a little girl no more than 10 years of age. We are able to follow this young girl's life and take in through different perspectives as to how the leprosy problem was handled from the outside and inside of Molokai.

        <li class="subh"><u>Marcus's Critique</u></li>
        <li><p> The story of Rachel Kalama on the island of Molokai has been one that leaves a haunting sense of the reality the leper colony on Moloka'i have faced for countless years. Alan Brennert's novel Moloka'i is based on research into the history of this colony. He emphasizes the personal triumphs of many of these patients, and that is a story which has long needed telling. Instead of elaborating on the horrors of the disease in order to build up drama, as a less skillful writer might have done, Brennert recognizes their dignity and respects them. Though no book about leprosy and the colony at Kalaupapa can ever be free from profound pain and despair, Brennert avoids turning this novel into a sob story, and focuses primarily on the lives the patient's create for themselves on the Kalaupapa settlement and on their attempts at normalcy.
          <br>
          <br>
        Leprosy in the past was known as the ‘separating disease’ because anyone to have been diagnosed with the ailment was forcibly removed from their homes. This was true to our main protagonist Rachel Kalama when her mother noticed the sores that wouldn’t heal on her 6 year old daughter’s leg, she did what she could to try to heal and hide the marks, this ranged from praying to new and old gods, visiting healers, and practiced strict secrecy. But Rachel’s mark was discovered and she was immediately taken away to the local hospital for tests. The dreaded diagnosis came back quickly with Rachel having leprosy. After a year of isolation, medical treatment, and testing, it was then decided that Rachel, at only 7 years old, would be sent to the leper colony on Moloka’i.
        <br>
        <br> 
        And there begins Rachel’s new life in exile on the island of Molokai.   Her uncle Pono and new aunt visit often, and she receives letters and packages from her father and every once in a while, her father is allowed to visit her. She quickly makes friends with the other girls her age, goes to school, and finds love and affection from the nuns who tend to their illness, as well as getting the chance to surf in the ocean whenever she is afforded the opportunity. Furthermore, the "family" Rachel develops on Kalaupapa, the friendships she makes with the other young children, and her refusal to let the disease control her makes her life bearable, and this allows the reader to admire her optimism even while dreading what her future holds. 
        <br><br>
        Yet Rachel is one of those with whom the disease develops very slowly, and her story continues through her teen years, her marriage, and well beyond. Through the lively Rachel, Brennert captures for us the history of the Kalaupapa settlement, the history of treatment for leprosy, and in turn the the history of Hawaii after its annexation, including the seizure of the Queen and the annexation and colonization of the islands by the American sugar barons (events which clearly parallel Rachel's story). The misconceptions about the spread of the disease and the ostracism of innocent families are brought to life through episodes about Rachel's family and those of her friends at Kalaupapa.   
        <br><br> 
        Moloka'i is a brilliant read, no where in the novel does Brennert attempt to make Rachel some sort of heroine, or keep her safe while everyone around her suffered. Her disease not only shattered her and challenged her to find the strength to live on her own, but also challenged her to fight the odds and make her life meaningful regardless of having leprosy or not. Over the years, Rachel meets a variety of people that even we as the readers will come to love and pray for. And this motley cast of people are not just treated as faceless extras, but have are seen as actual people with interesting back-stories and are molded into fully-fleshed characters by Brennert.
        <br><br>
        The initial part of this book was hard to read, not because of the language or lack of intrigue, but because it was hard reading about a 7 year old girl forcibly separated from her parents by a disease she wasn't even old enough to even comprehend. Being sent to Molokai, from where no one really returns from, reminded me of my dad passed away when I was seven. I can relate to the sadness and despair Rachel was going through, not being able to see your parents again, and feeling like you’ve been left alone in this cold, dark, and scary world all alone.
        <br><br>
        For victims of leprosy, Moloka'i was understood to be their grave even before they were to die. But for all the despair associated with this settlement, people in Moloka'i knew how to enjoy life. The people partied, danced, had their own cozy homes, and the made best with what they had given their circumstances. At times, I saw a civilization that was far more tolerant and cohesive than in other places around the world at this time in history. They understood each other at a level other people didn't. While others shunned them as outcasts and looked at them with disgust, and revulsion the people who had leprosy confided in each other to find a sense of belonging and companionship that they were denied by others who didn’t have the disease.
        <br><br>
        Just as with any real life, horrible atrocities are apart of it, as well glorious events of familial or agape love. Moloka’i will have you reaching for the box of tissues, only to have you smiling again by the time the tissues are in hand.  It is an emotional roller coaster with a plethora of pinnacle moments and lows that reach into the depths of hell. With that said I highly recommend you reading Rachel’s journey as she goes on through life living it to the fullest, given her circumstances, on the beautiful island of Molokai.

        <li class="subh"><u>Brian's Critique</u></li>
        <li><p> Similar to a painting, a book is a form of art, a form of expression, but with words. Each book holds an interesting story created from the mind of the author. As we open a book, we dive deep into the author's world and become fascinated with what's inside. As a new generation unfolds, it his hard for many books to be remembered. New stories are born while old stories fade away in memory. It is why it is important for us to recall these stories and spread their existence in the present. That way, the memory of this story shall be preserved for the next generation to experience.

        Molokai is novel that unravels one of Hawaii's most darkest eras of all: the leprosy outbreak.Through this book, a person will get to view the struggles of the lepers in Hawaii, including their banishment into the leper colony on the island of Molokai and the anguish they must face from the skin-rotting effects of the disease. Once landing on the island shores, a young Rachel is pitted into a lifelong course of challenges while being crept upon by the disease that brought her into Molokai. For those who are into researching Hawaiian history, especially the leper outbreak incident, I would highly recommend reading this book.
